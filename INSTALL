Installation
------------

* Build and install the software in the usual way:
     ./configure && make && [sudo] make install

* Add these lines to your ~/.emacs (substitute correct path):

  (add-to-list 'load-path "/usr/local/share/wrangler/elisp")
  (require 'wrangler)
 
  (If you used an install prefix other than /usr/local, change  
   the first line appropriately.)
     
You should now be to use Wrangler. If you have problems, please send a
note to 'erlang-refactor@kent.ac.uk'.
