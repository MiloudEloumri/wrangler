Modified the pretty-printer to take the original program layout (Paper and 
Ribbon width) into account. The result seems very pretty good.


2008-01-22 hl(hl@kent.ac.uk).


Change the clone detector so that the reported clones are eith expression 
sequence or function sequence, that is true candidates for clone removal.


2008-01-07 hl:

Newly create plt table fro stdlib.

bugfix within refac_util:bifs_side_effect_table().


2008-01-07: hl(hl@kent.ac.uk).

added function refac_util:tokenize/1 to replace the used of refac_epp:scan/3, 
because the later has problems when macros are used.

2008-01-07: hl(hl@kent.ac.uk).

Change to 'generalisation': when the selected expression contains free variables, asks the user whether she/he wants to continue the refactoring. If the 
answer is 'yes', then the selected expression will be wrapped in a fun-expression, the the free variables serve as the parameter. 



2008-01-04: hl(hl@kent.ac.uk)

bug fix within refac_syntax_lib:vann_receive_expr/2 regarding to the exported 
variables. This is a bug from SyntaxTools, and we should report it. 

2008-01-04: hl (hl@kent.ac.uk)

Bug fix within refac_fold_expression.erl to filter out those false positive 
from the initial result of expr_unificaiton/2.

2007-12-18 :HL (hl@kent.ac.uk)
Some modules regarding to the analysis of atom information have been removed 
from the current code base, but they are available from the previous Wrangler 
releases/snapshots.

2007-12-18: hl(hl@kent.ac.uk).


With 'generalisation a function definition', Wrangler now asks the user 
whether the selected expression has side effect or not in the case that 
Wrangler itself can not infer it.

2007-12-16: hl(hl@kent.ac.uk).

Refactored the side-effect checking part. The current implementation 
uses two side-effect tables: one for the libraries from Erlang release;
the other for the program under refactoring. The local side side-effect 
table is incrementally built. 

2007-12-14: HL(hl@kent.ac.uk).

Removed modules refac_compile.erl and refac_atom_info.erl, as they are 
not used by the current Wrangler. (we might need them later, so keep a 
copy of them somewhere else.)

2007-12-12: Hl(hl@kent.ac.uk).

New refactoring added: folding against a function definition.

2007-12-04: HL(hl@kent.ac.uk).

Introduce a function definition to represent a selected expression/expression sequence.

2007-11-29: HL (hl@kent.ac.uk).

* Rrimplemented the module graph calculation part. The new version no longer 
depends on the Erlang compiler.

2007-11-28:Huiqing Li (hl@kent.ac.uk).

* Updated Makefile.in to take system info into account.

2007-11-18:Huiqing Li (hl@kent.ac.uk).

* Merged refac_duplicated_code.erl and refac_duplicated_code_in_files.erl

2007-11-14: Huiqing Li (hl@kent.ac.uk).

* Created a new cvs repository due to the re-construction of Wrangler.

2007-11-13: Huiqing Li(hl@kent.ac.uk).
* Added new module refac_expr_search.erl, which provides functionalities for 
expression clones search within a singlw module.

& Bug fixed within refac_util.er with in do_add_range for the case of fun expression.

2007-11-07: Huiqing Li(hl@kent.ac.uk).

* Reorgnised the wrangler directory by putting .erl files into the erl directory, and .hrl files to the hrl directory.

* Changes to Makefile.in to refect the changes with the wrangler directory structure.  

* create file wrangler.hrl.src, which is used to created wrangler.hrl during the make process, so that we can detect the path to the side-effect table correctly.

* It seems that Windows vista does not support distel-3.3 very welll, especially the dec32.exe, so I am now using the cvs version of distel from distel.google.code.

2007-10-31: Huiqing Li(hl@kent,ac,uk).

* Added functionality for duplicated code detection among mulitiple modules.

2007-10-30: Huiqing Li(hl@kent.ac.uk).
* Added new functionality: duplicated code detection. 
The current duplicated code detection only works with a single module.

*In Refac_util.erl, a new version of add_range/1 has been created in order 
to take into account those keywords/brackets/... surrounding a syntax phrase. 

2007-10-19: Huiqing Li (hl@kent.ac.uk).

* Refactoring: move the part in distel.erl that belong to Wrangler into a sperate module 'Wranlger_distel.erl', so that we can keep the distel.erl from distel 
relase untouched.

*  Bug fix with 'move a definition to another module'. Bug was: when the target module does not exist, Wrangler does not create it correctly.

2007-10-16: Huiqing Li (hl@kent.ac.uk).

*Bug fix within function scan/6 in file refac_scan.erl to get the column number of '_' correct.

*Bug fix within functions has_side_effect/3 and build_sideeffect_ab/3. 
Now use macro ?WRANGLER_DIR to remember the directory of wrangler.          
NOTE: currently ?WRANGLER_DIR is hard-coded in wrangler.hrl. This must be 
changed with the next release.


2007-10-08: Huiqing Li (hl@kent.ac.uk). 

* bug fix with function try_evaluation/1. This function occurs in several modules with the same definition, so moved it to refac_util.erl. I have also 
renamed the parameter name from Parse to Expr. This is actually a very good 
refactoring example involving a few basic refactorings.  

* Added '\n' to the end of the warning message in refac_gen.erl and refac_move_fun.erl.
